# Collaboration Workflows in Git

## Overview
Collaboration is one of the most powerful aspects of Git. This lesson introduces common workflows for working with others on shared projects, including feature branches, pull requests, forking, and contributing to open source repositories.

## Step 2: Pull Requests

A pull request (PR) is a request to merge your branch into another branch (usually `main` or `master`). PRs are used for code review and discussion before changes are integrated.

1. **Go to your repository on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).**
2. **Find your recently pushed branch and click "New Pull Request" or "Merge Request".**
3. **Describe your changes and submit the request.**
4. **Reviewers can comment, request changes, or approve the PR.**
5. **Once approved, the branch can be merged into the main branch.**
