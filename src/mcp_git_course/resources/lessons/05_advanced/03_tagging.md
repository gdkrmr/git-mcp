# Tagging Commits in Git

## Overview
Tags in Git are used to mark specific points in your repositoryâ€™s history, such as releases or milestones. Tags make it easy to reference important commits and share stable versions of your project.

## 1. Create a Lightweight Tag

1. In your project directory, create a tag for the current commit:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0
   ```
2. Verify the tag was created:
   ```bash
   git tag
   ```
   You should see `v1.0` listed.

## 2. Create an Annotated Tag

1. Create an annotated tag with a message:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.1 -m "Release version 1.1"
   ```
2. View details of the annotated tag:
   ```bash
   git show v1.1
   ```

## 3. Tag a Specific Commit

1. Find the commit hash you want to tag:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```
2. Tag that commit:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.2 <commit-hash>
   ```

## 4. Push Tags to Remote

1. Push a single tag to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin v1.0
   ```
2. Push all tags:
   ```bash
   git push --tags
   ```
3. Verify tags on the remote platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

## 5. List and Delete Tags

1. List all tags:
   ```bash
   git tag
   ```
2. Delete a local tag:
   ```bash
   git tag -d v1.0
   ```
3. Delete a remote tag:
   ```bash
   git push origin --delete v1.0
   ```

## Conclusion

Tags are essential for marking releases and important milestones in your project. Practice creating, viewing, and pushing tags to ensure you can manage project versions effectively.
