*Lesson 01: Basics, Step 03: What is Version Control?*
# What is Version Control?

## Overview
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to track modifications, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others. This document outlines the importance of version control and provides an overview of various types of version control systems.

## Importance of Version Control

1. **Collaboration**
   - Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously.
   - Teams can manage contributions from different members without losing changes.

2. **History and Tracking**
   - Keeps a detailed history of changes made to files, including who made them and when.
   - Allows you to revert to previous versions if needed, enabling recovery from mistakes.

3. **Branching and Experimentation**
   - You can create branches to experiment or develop features without affecting the main codebase.
   - Merging branches allows for integrating changes when they are ready.

4. **Backup and Restore**
   - Acts as a backup system for your code and files.
   - Easily restore earlier versions of a project.

## Types of Version Control Systems (VCS)

1. **Local Version Control Systems**
   - Tracks changes on a single machine.
   - Example: RCS (Revision Control System).

2. **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**
   - Requires a central server to store all versioned files.
   - Users check out files from the central server and commit changes back.
   - Example: Subversion (SVN), CVS.

3. **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**
   - Each user has a complete copy of the repository, including its history.
   - Changes can be shared with others when needed.
   - Example: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar.

## Conclusion
Understanding version control is critical for modern software development and collaborative projects. It enhances productivity and reduces the risk of errors when managing multiple versions of files. In the next lesson, we will introduce Git, one of the most popular version control systems used today.

## Questions
1. Why is version control important, specifically in software development?
2. What are the advantages of using a distributed version control system like git over a centralized one?
3. Describe a scenario where version control facilitates collaboration among team members.
4. How does version control help in tracking the history of a project?
