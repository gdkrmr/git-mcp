## Forking a Repository

Forking is used when you want to contribute to a repository you don't have write access to (e.g., open source projects).

1. **Click "Fork" on the repository page (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).**
2. **This creates a copy of the repository under your account.**
3. **Clone your fork to your local machine:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@host:user/forked-repo.git
   ```
4. **Create a feature branch, make changes, and push to your fork.**
5. **Open a pull request from your fork to the original repository.**

## Contributing to Open Source

When contributing to open source projects, follow these steps:

1. **Read the project's contribution guidelines (often in `CONTRIBUTING.md`).**
2. **Fork the repository and clone it locally.**
3. **Create a new branch for your changes.**
4. **Make your changes and commit them with clear messages.**
5. **Push your branch to your fork.**
6. **Open a pull request to the original repository.**
7. **Participate in code review and respond to feedback.**
